## 1. Installing VS Code
A chromebook can be an inexpensive way to develop, but by itself, does not support tools such as VS Code.  In order to install VS Code, you need to do a few things:

1. Enable Linux on your Chromebook (this will be a Debian Linux)
2. Install some dependencies (via terminal window)
3. Install VSCode - this will depend on your Chromebook processor

## 2. Install some development tools/SDKs
You'll want to install things such as Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.

---
## 3. Install a Database (we'll do MongoDB)
You'll also want to install a database, so you can build/develop a full stack.  For this, we'll use MongoDB (you could choose another)

That should be it, you should now be set to go.
